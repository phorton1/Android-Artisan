    The context menu commands are primarily for the Playlist,
    or for moving things to the playlist from the Library.

    However, some of these *could* be available on the Library,
    in the future.  At that time, more explicit names will be
    needed for the destination when in the Library i.e. there
    might need to be a context_menu_add_playlist command.
